		This option enables meson global timer which is
		a multi-function timer supoort gpio/mipi trigger and gpio
		output and includes several parts sub module

if AMLOGIC_GLOBAL_TIMER

config AMLOGIC_GLOBAL_TIMER_CORE
	tristate "amlogic global timer core driver"
	default n
	help
		This option enables meson global timer core which is
		used to get current time stamp counter. Also, api for other
		driver, sysfs and ioctl for user land are supported.

config AMLOGIC_GLOBAL_TIMER_ISP
	tristate "amlogic global timer isp driver"
	default n
	help
		This option support time stamp for ISP to get the current counter
		of starting frame and ending frame. There are 10 such trigger
		source.

	tristate "amlogic global timer output driver"
	default n
	help
		Output pulse function is used to output specified pulse, pulse
		width, interval between pulses, oneshot or continue mode are
		supported. This function is independent among global timer
		drivers.

config AMLOGIC_GLOBAL_TIMER_INPUT
	tristate "amlogic global timer input driver"
	default n
	help
		This driver is used to latch counter value of global timer when
		specified GPIO interrupt trigger. 32 GPIOs are supported at the
		same time.
