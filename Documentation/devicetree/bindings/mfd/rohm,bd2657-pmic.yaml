description: |
  The BD2657SWV is a Power Management Integrated Circuit available in
  28pins-USMP028X3527 package and dedicated to application powered by one
  Li-Ion or Li-Ion polymer battery cell, or by an input from 2.85 V to
  5.5 V. The device provides 4 dynamic voltage scaling capable buck
  converters and is designed to support various power requirements. The
  BD2657 also provides two GPOs and a power-button connectivity.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: rohm,bd2657

  reg:

      I2C slave address.
    maxItems: 1

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1

  gpio-controller: true

  "#gpio-cells":
    const: 2
    description: |
      The first cell is the pin number and the second cell is used to specify
      flags. See ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.

  regulators:
    $ref: ../regulator/rohm,bd2657-regulator.yaml
    description:
      List of child nodes that specify the regulators.
  rohm,power-button-connected:
    description: Power-button is connected to PMIC.
    type: boolean

  rohm,output-power-state-gpio:
    description: |
      GPIO0 is used to advertice the PMIC power state and is not used as SW
      controllable GPIO pin.
    type: boolean

  gpio-reserved-ranges:
    description: |
      Usage of BD2657 GPIO0 pin can be changed by the register. Usage of
      the GPIO1 pin depends on OTP. GPIO0 can be used to advertice the
      PMIC power-state and GPIO1 pin may be used as PMIC_EN signal input.
      You should set this property to mark the pins which are not used for GPIO.
      Please see the ../gpio/gpio.txt for more information.
