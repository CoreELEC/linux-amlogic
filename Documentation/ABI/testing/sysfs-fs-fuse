Description:
		bpf_prog_type_fuse defines the program type of bpf programs that
		may be passed to fuse-bpf. For upstream bpf program types, this
		is a constant defined in a contiguous array of constants.
		bpf_prog_type_fuse is appended to the end of the list, so it may
		change and therefore its value must be read from this file.

		Contents is ASCII decimal representation of bpf_prog_type_fuse
